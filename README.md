Scripts
=======
Let's see how good I am at uploading scripts I write here to github.

First up, mjpg-streamer-init.
It's meant to start/stop a modified version of mjpg-streamer (by jacksonliam). It also allows you to set the mode to day or night and it will try to kill a running instance when changing the mode.
Instructions are in the file, try it out!

Send any feedback to me on twitter @foamz
